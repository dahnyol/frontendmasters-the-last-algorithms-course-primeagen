What are these things exactly? 
Is it an algorithm or a data structure?
It uses a data structure, we perform an algorithm on top of the data structure. 
What is a linked list? 
The insertion is the algorithmic side, the actual setup is the data structure itself?

Our first data structure on top of a linked list is going to be a queue.

QUEUE : First In First Out 

One of the most common data structures implemented.
    (ex from instructor: had to shove a video down a video decoder, had to use a buffer too do this. When inserting this it is important to have the correct order, first in first out. he used a queue to accomplish this.)

A queue is just a specific implementation of a linked list.

    (A) -> (B) -> (C) -> (D)
     |                    |
     h                    t

We have a pointer to head (A) and tail (D)

// what if we insert E to the tail?
// this.tail.next = E ; Update our current tail (D) to point to (E)
// this.tail = E ; Update our tail to point to (E)

// what if we want to pop the head?
// we want to move the head forward
// const = head, point head to B, then take the previous old head, remove the link and return the value.
// this.head = head  
// head = head.next
// h.next = null
// return h.val

Implement a queue is simple because it constraints what you can do. First in first out, you only operate on the head or tail, both of which are constant operations.
The pushing into a queue is constant, popping from a queue is the same thing in reverse, which is constant, so a queue is 
constant time.

A very fast specific algorithm, first in, first out.

Running time
-enqueue
-deque
-peek (check first element without popping it off)

In the world of Data Structures and Algorithms, constraints make things fast.
Many times datastructures that are fast are because of the lack of features.

Underneath the good of a queue, it is a generalized linked list. 

// Implementing a Queue //
// queue node that is generic over T

type Node<T> = {
    value: T,
    next?: Node<T>, // we don't know if there will be another node
}

export default class Queue<T> {
    public length: number;
    private head?: Node<T> // head? functions the same as -> | undefined
    private tail?: Node<T> // head and tail have references even if undefined, they are of generic node over T.
    
    // now we can pass an value, we create our own container and manage the state ourselves.
    constructor() {
        this.head = this.tail = undefined;
        this.length = 0;
    }
    // add to que
    enqueue(item: T): void {
        const node = {value: item} as Node<T>;
        this.length++; // add item to que update size 
        // if no tail, it is an empty array
        if (!this.tail) {
            // our next is undefined, our value is the item, its of type T, node is generic over T
            this.tail = this.head = node;
            return;
        }
        // took our tail and added a new one to the list
        this.tail.next = node;
        // now we point to the new tail
        this.tail = node;
    }   
    // remove from que
    deque(): T | undefined {
        // first check, do we have a head? if no head return undefined
        if (!this.head) {
            return undefined;
        }

        this.length--; // we remove item so update length 
        // we first update head to point to the next value
        // save our head const head
        const head = this.head;
        // update our head pointer to the next one
        this.head = this.head.next;
        // free - garbage collection (not needed in JavaScript)
        head.next = undefined;
        // return head value
        return head.value;
    }   
    // look at the front of que
    peek(): T | undefined {
        return this.head?.value; // null coalescing operator, if head is not null or not undefined, return the value, else return undefined

    }
